# surfs_up

## Overview
Based on information gathered during the analysis, an investment idea came to light to set up a Surf and Shake shop serving surfboards and ice cream to locals and tourists on the beautiful island of Awahoo, Hawaii. However, starting a new business needs not only money, time, and effort, but a great knowledge to identify if our idea is in the correct time and place, and if an investor can be convinced to join in. W. Avy, an investor passionate about surfing and Hawaii, is interested and has asked a few key questions to better evaluate the project including help bring other investors on-board. .

## Results
In order to achieve this goal, W. Avy asked us to do an analysis of the weather and get the statistics from the months of June and December since the climate in this area changes constantly and it will be better to have a look at what we will be facing over the whole year beforehand.

* First, there are more references points in June (1,700 points) than in December (1,517 points), which means that June is a month where we can expect major climate changes.

* Furthermore, the min and max temperatures that can be reached during June are 64 F. and 85 F. respectively, while during December the min and max temperatures that can be reached are 56 F. and 83 F. respectively.

## Summary
As part of giving W.Avy the best material and information possible about the Surf and Shake shop, we have created two more queries with tables that represent the precipitation calculation for the months of June and December.

* In June, we can see that the minimum and maximum inches of precipitation go from 0.00 to 4.43 respectively and the average precipitation is 0.13 inches.

These tables not only show us how the climate changes during different seasons of the year but also within any month of the year we want to start our project. With this information we will be better prepeared to plan opening of the store as that will coincide with when there are more tourists and surfers.  Based on available information, the idea to open a store is a good one and the potential exist for a successful business.
